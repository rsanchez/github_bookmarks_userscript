# GitHub Bookmarks Userscript #

Sometimes "watching" a repo is overkill and it just fills up my news feed. This userscript allows you to "bookmark" a repo, using HTML5 localStorage. You won't see your "bookmarked" repos in your news feed, but rather, you will find a list of them on your home page, below your Watched Repos list. On repo pages you will find a Bookmark/Unbookmark button. Tested on Safari with NinjaKit.
